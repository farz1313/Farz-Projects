1. House Pricing Prediction 
<br>
    A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. I built a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house. Also, determined the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression. 
Business Goal -You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

2. Telecom Churn 
<br>
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.
For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
In this project, I analysed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

The dataset provided here was extracted from the NSE website. The Stock price data provided is from 1-Jan-2015 to 31-July-2018 for six stocks Eicher Motors, Hero, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Infosys and TCS. I analysed and wrote a brief summary of the results obtained and what inferences you can draw from the analysis performed.

<summary>CAPSTONE PROJECT</summary>
<p>
Inspiration 
<br>
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
</br>
<br>
Problem Statement-The aim of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models.
</br>
<br>
Actions and final objective
</br>
<br>
1. The model will be trained on data which comprises of label feature that gives an information about a transaction, 1 for fraud, and 0 for good transaction.
2. Transactions lying in outliers will be considered to be fraud.
3. Recall scores will be used to evaluate model performance.

<summary>DEEP LEARNING NEURAL NETWORK</summary>
<p>
In this assignment, I implemented an L-layered deep neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contained scanned images of handwritten digits, along with their correct classification labels (between 0-9). MNIST's name comes from the fact that it is a modified subset of two data sets collected by NIST, the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.

<summary>MACHINE LEARNING</summary>
<p>
Business Goal- I modeled the price of cars with the available independent variables. It was used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Project Description<br>
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, I analyzed a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. I performed Natural Language Processing using Python, pandas, sklearn, and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research.
