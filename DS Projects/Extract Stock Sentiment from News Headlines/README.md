<summary>Project Description</summary>
<p> 
  In this project, I investigated insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from Finviz. Understood the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock.

The datasets used in this project were raw HTML files for the Facebook (FB) and Tesla (TSLA) stocks from FINVIZ.com, a popular website dedicated to stock information and news.
